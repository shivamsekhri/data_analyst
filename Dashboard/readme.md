# IBM Cognos Product Performance Dashboard
This interactive dashboard was built using the data provided in CustomerLoyaltyProgram_Full.csv. The data has information about customer purchases for different products in different geographies after several marketing campaigns were conducted. The data was analysed to understand the difference in product sales for indivisual regions and coupons. 

The Dashboard contains four different charts:

Radial Chart:
The radial chart displays multiple variables in a circular format with axes radiating from a central point. It offers a holistic view for comparing entities across criteria, aiding in the identification of strengths and weaknesses.

Packed Bubble Chart:
Packed bubble charts use circles to represent data points, efficiently showcasing multiple dimensions. With tight packing and color coding for additional insights, they excel in presenting hierarchical and categorical data clearly and engagingly.

Stacked Column Chart:
Stacked column charts visually display the composition of a whole across categories, using columns segmented into stacked sections for sub-categories. Effective for illustrating trends over time or data distribution, they offer a straightforward representation of the data's structure.

Bubble Chart:
Bubble charts use circles to represent data points in a two-dimensional graph, with bubble size indicating a third variable. Dynamic and versatile, they visually convey complex relationships between variables, making them ideal for identifying correlations and outliers.

Any product category or coupon number can be selected and the dashboard automatically updates all charts to focus on the data corresonding to that particular category or coupon.
