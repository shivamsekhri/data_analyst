Welcome to the Alien Invasion game, a thrilling adventure built using the pygame module. In this adrenaline-pumping challenge, players take control of a powerful rocket ship stationed at the bottom center of the screen. Armed with agility and firepower, they maneuver the ship horizontally using arrow keys while unleashing a barrage of bullets with the spacebar to fend off the impending alien threat.

As the game unfolds, a relentless fleet of extraterrestrial adversaries descends upon the skies, advancing methodically across and down the screen. Players must swiftly eliminate these alien intruders before they breach the planet's defenses. With each wave vanquished, the aliens' assault escalates, presenting players with increasingly formidable challenges.

But beware! Collisions between an alien and the player's ship, or the aliens reaching the bottom of the screen, spell doom and result in the loss of a precious life. With only three lives at their disposal, players must demonstrate cunning and skill to survive the relentless onslaught.
