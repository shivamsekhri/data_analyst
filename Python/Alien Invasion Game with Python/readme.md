Welcome to "Alien Invasion," an engaging game crafted using the pygame module. In this thrilling adventure, players take command of a rocket ship situated at the bottom center of the screen. Utilizing precision and strategy, players navigate the ship horizontally using arrow keys, while deploying bullets with the spacebar to thwart the encroaching alien menace.

As the game commences, a formidable fleet of extraterrestrial adversaries dominates the skies, advancing methodically across and down the screen. Players must swiftly eliminate these alien threats before they breach the defenses. With each successive wave defeated, the aliens' onslaught intensifies, challenging players to demonstrate ever greater skill and reflexes.

Beware, however, as any collision between an alien and the player's ship, or the aliens reaching the bottom of the screen, results in a loss of precious lives. Should players exhaust their three allotted lives, the game reaches its conclusion.

Embark on an epic journey of survival, where quick thinking and precise execution are paramount. Can you fend off the relentless alien invasion and emerge victorious?
