Visualization: Generates informative visualizations using Seaborn, Matplotlib,
and Power BI to identify patterns and trends in delay occurrences.

Insights: Provides actionable insights into the most frequent incidents causing delays,
variations in delay occurrence by direction and location, and trends over time.
Recommendations: Offers recommendations for optimizing routes, enhancing infrastructure,
and implementing targeted interventions to mitigate delays.
